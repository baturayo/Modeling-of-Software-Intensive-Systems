To run HarmonicOscillator.py and plot the error of harmonic oscillator error with derivative blocks do not change anything
To plot harmonic oscillator error using integral blocks you need to change line 218 to cbd = HOIntegraleErrorBlock("number_gen").
To plot harmonic oscillator plot using integral blocks change line 218 to cbd = HOIntegralTest("number_gen") and line 226 to
for timeValuePair in cbd.getSignal("OutIntegral"):
To plot harmonic oscillator plot using derivative blocks change line 218 to cbd = HODerivativeTest("number_gen") and line 226 to
for timeValuePair in cbd.getSignal("OutDerivative"):

To run the DriverlessTrain cbd with parameters (200,0,0), run Runandplot200.py in the CBD_assignment_startingpoint folder.

To run the DriverlessTrain cbd with the tuned parameters, run RunandplotTune.py in the CBD_assignment_startingpoint folder.

Both these scripts will run the cbd for 350 seconds and will then plot the expected graphs.

The file OptimalSolution contains our implementation of an optimizer. Keep in mind that running this file might take a long time.
